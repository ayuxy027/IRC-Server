When working with HTTP Requests, such as GET, POST, or others

Handling them with looping if-else statements can quickly lead to code clutter and a decline in readability and quality.

Express.js effectively resolves this issue by providing a streamlined and organized framework for managing routes and handling requests.


<------ Working Of Express ------->

1. const Express = require "express";

2. then make an object= express()

3. then start using

 ex - app.method (path, (req, res)=>
      {
      return res.end("Output)
      })
